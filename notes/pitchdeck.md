# ConPaws Pitch Deck

> Navigate, Connect, Enjoy — Your furry convention companion app.

---

## TL;DR

- **Market:** 100K-300K active furries, 170+ conventions/year, 10%+ annual growth.
- **Gap:** No universal convention companion app exists (Barq just added schedules but needs internet + is 18+ only).
- **ConPaws edge:** Offline-first, all ages, focused UX, no moderation burden.
- **Pricing:** Free (useful) → $3.99/mo or $24.99/yr. Apple/Google take 15%.
- **Costs:** $136/year. Break even in 6-9 months.
- **Solo dev, $0 marketing, bootstrapped.** Built by a furry for furries.

---

## The Problem

Every furry convention-goer deals with:
- Paper schedules that get lost or outdated
- Convention apps that barely work (if they exist at all)
- Con WiFi that dies under 10,000+ people
- No easy way to plan across multiple conventions
- Scattered info — schedule on one site, map on another, socials on a third

**There is no universal furry convention companion app.**

---

## The Solution

**ConPaws** — a free, offline-first mobile app that works at any furry convention.

- Browse events and build your personal schedule
- Create your fursona profile
- Works without WiFi (because con WiFi is a myth)
- Optional premium tier (ConPaws+) for cloud sync and extras

### Demographics

|------------|--------|
| Age range | 60% are 18-30 (digital native, tech-savvy) |
| Average age | 28.3 years |
| LGBTQ+ | 76% identify as non-heterosexual |

## Business Model

### Free Tier (Everyone)
- Full schedule browsing and personal schedule
- Fursona profile with built-in avatars
- Offline-first — all data stored locally

|------|-------|----------------------|
| Monthly | $3.99/mo | $3.39/mo net |

**Premium features:**
- Cloud sync across devices

### Addressable Market Math

| | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Convention-goers who download | 500 | 2,000 | 5,000 |
| Free-to-paid conversion rate | 2% | 3% | 5% |
| Paying subscribers | 10 | 60 | 250 |
| Annual revenue (avg $30/yr) | $300 | $1,800 | $7,500 |
| Annual profit | $189 | $1,689 | $7,389 |

With 170+ conventions and combined attendance in the hundreds of thousands, even capturing a small fraction of the market makes ConPaws self-sustaining.

## Competitive Landscape

### The Main Competitor: Barq

[Barq](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/barq/id1526984545) is a furry social networking app by solo dev Woutske. iOS and Android. As of **February 13, 2026**, they are now a direct competitor.

**Barq v2.10 (launched Feb 13, 2026) added:**
- Convention Schedule 1.0 — browse events, panels, meetups by day
- "My Schedule" — personal schedule with add/remove
- Event details — time, location, description, category tags
- Find Your Friends — real-time friend map (opt-in)
- Convention partnerships with furry cons for schedule data

**Barq also has (existing features):**
- Furry social networking — find furries near you
- Multiple fursona profiles with customizable layouts
- Community groups and real-time messaging
- 18+ only (has explicit content areas with "AD Mode")

**This is real overlap.** Barq now does schedule browsing + personal schedule + friend finding — three of ConPaws' planned core features. Their announcement got 328 likes and 16K views.

### Where ConPaws Can Still Differentiate

| Feature | ConPaws | Barq |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Core purpose** | Convention companion (focused) | Social network + convention (bolted on) |
| **Offline-first** | Yes (entire app works without WiFi) | Unlikely (social features need internet) |
| **Age requirement** | All ages | 18+ only |
| **Explicit content** | Never | Yes (AD Mode) |
| **App complexity** | Simple, one job | Large social app with many features |
| **Schedule is...** | The whole app | One feature among many |
| **Messaging/chat** | No (lean, no moderation burden) | Yes |
| **Fursona profiles** | Yes (1 per user) | Yes (multiple) |
| **Find Friends** | Premium, at-con only | Free, real-time map |

### Honest Assessment

**Barq's advantages:**
- Already launched with convention partnerships
- Existing user base and brand recognition
- Schedule + social + friends in one app
- First mover on convention schedule (as of today)

**ConPaws' remaining advantages:**
- **Offline-first** — This is the killer differentiator. Con WiFi is notoriously terrible. If Barq's schedule needs internet, ConPaws wins every time the WiFi drops.
- **All ages** — Barq's 18+ gate excludes younger furries. The fandom skews young.
- **Focused UX** — One app, one job. No social feed, no DMs, no explicit content toggle. Just your convention schedule.
- **No moderation burden** — No messaging = no abuse reports, no content moderation, no trust & safety costs.
- **Privacy-first** — No social graph, no location tracking beyond opt-in at-con.

### Strategic Options

1. **Stay the course** — Build ConPaws as planned. Bet on offline-first + all-ages + focused UX. Barq's schedule is v1.0 and may be rough. There's room for a better, simpler tool.
2. **Pivot to differentiate harder** — Double down on what Barq CAN'T do easily: offline support, convention-specific features (maps, packing lists, expense tracking), all-ages.
3. **Niche down** — Target the audience Barq excludes: under-18 furries, privacy-conscious users, people who don't want a social network.
4. **Rethink scope** — If Barq covers schedule well enough, ConPaws could focus on the convention *planning* side (pre-con checklists, budgeting, travel) rather than at-con schedule.

### Other Alternatives

| Solution | Problems |
|----------|----------|
| Convention-specific apps | Only work for one con. Rebuilt every year. Often abandoned. |
| Guidebook / Sched.com | Generic event apps. Not furry-specific. No fursona profiles. |
| Google Sheets / spreadsheets | Manual, ugly, no offline support |
| Paper schedules | Get lost, can't update, no personalization |
| Social media / Telegram groups | Scattered info, no schedule building |

### ConPaws Moat
- **Offline-first** — THE differentiator. Con WiFi fails constantly. If your schedule app needs internet, it fails when you need it most.
- **All ages** — Barq's 18+ requirement cuts out younger furries.
- **Focused simplicity** — One app, one job. No social network bloat.
- **Privacy-first** — No social graph, no messaging, no explicit content.
- **No moderation burden** — No DMs = no abuse, no trust & safety costs, no legal risk.

## Tech Stack (For the Nerds)

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| App framework | Expo (React Native) — iOS + Android from one codebase |
| Styling | NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for mobile) |
| Local database | SQLite via Prisma ORM |
| Cloud backend | Supabase (self-hosted) — PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage |
| File storage | Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) |
| Payments | RevenueCat (handles Apple + Google subscriptions) |
| Crash reporting | Sentry |
| Website | Astro on Netlify (static, zero JS) |

**Key architecture:** Offline-first. Free users = local SQLite. Premium users = cloud sync via Supabase. The app works without internet by design.

---

---

## The Ask

This is a **bootstrapped indie project**. No funding needed.

- Total investment: ~$136/year
- Break even: 6-9 months
- Profitable by end of year 1

**ConPaws exists to serve the furry convention community, not to maximize revenue.** Premium features fund development. The free tier stays genuinely useful forever.

---

## TL;DR

- **170+ furry conventions** happen every year, attendance growing 10%+ annually
- **No universal convention companion app exists** — ConPaws fills the gap
- **Free app**, premium at $3.99/mo or $24.99/yr
- **$136 total cost** to launch, break even in 6-9 months
- **Solo dev, zero marketing budget**, built by a furry for furries
- **MVP target: June 2026** — in time for peak convention season
