# ConPaws Marketing Plan

> Navigate, Connect, Enjoy — Your furry convention companion app.

---

## TL;DR

- **Website:** Single-page Astro site on Netlify. Dark theme, playful, mobile-first. Hero + features + how it works + ConPaws+ + footer.
- **Discord:** Primary channel. Beta program, dev updates, feature polls.
- **Twitch:** Dev streams when building. Clip cool moments.
- **Twitter/X:** 2-3 posts/week. Screenshots + short captions win.
- **YouTube:** 60-90 sec launch video. Screen recordings, your voiceover.
- **Budget:** $136/year total. $0 marketing spend.
- **Break even:** ~9 months at 1 sub/month, ~6 months at 2 subs/month.
- **Timeline:** Build in public → Discord beta → Launch for convention season → Push at each con.

## Website (conpaws.com)

### Purpose
Single-page marketing site. Convince visitors to download the app. Keep it simple — Astro on Netlify (same stack as sharing pages, zero JS, free hosting).

### Sections (top to bottom)

**Hero**
- App icon + "ConPaws" wordmark
- Tagline: "Navigate, Connect, Enjoy"
- One-liner: "Your furry convention companion app"
- Two buttons: App Store / Google Play
- Phone mockup showing the app

**Features Grid (3-4 cards)**
- Schedule — "Never miss a panel again"
- Profile — "Show off your fursona"
- Offline-first — "Works without WiFi (con WiFi is terrible anyway)"
- ConPaws+ — "Sync across devices, support development"

**How It Works (3 steps)**
1. Download the app
2. Pick your convention
3. Build your schedule

**ConPaws+ Section**
- Brief premium pitch
- Price + what you get
- Keep it short — don't oversell

**Footer**
- Links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Contact
- Social links: Discord, Twitter/X, YouTube
- "Made with paws by MrDemonWolf"

### Design Vibe
- Dark theme preferred (matches the app)
- Friendly, playful, not corporate
- Paw print motifs — subtle, not overwhelming
- Mobile-first (most furries browse on phone)

## Social Media Strategy

### Where You Already Are

| Platform | Audience | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Discord | Your community | Beta testers, feedback, hype |
| Twitch | Your viewers | Live dev streams, demos |
| Twitter/X | Furry community | Announcements, screenshots, reach |
| YouTube | Everyone | Showcase video, tutorials |

### Discord (Primary Channel)

**Setup**
- Create a `#conpaws` channel in your server
- Add roles: `ConPaws Beta Tester`, `ConPaws+`
- Pin a post explaining what ConPaws is

**Content Cadence**
- Dev updates when you hit milestones (not every commit)
- Screenshot drops of new features
- Polls for feature priority ("what should I build next?")
- Beta invite drops (creates urgency)

**Beta Program**
- Discord-exclusive first access
- Give beta testers the `Beta Tester` role
- Dedicated feedback thread per feature
- Makes people feel invested early

### Twitch (Dev Streams)

**What to Stream**
- Building ConPaws live (IRL dev streams)
- "Let's design the schedule screen together"
- Bug squashing sessions
- Feature reveals on stream first

**Tips**
- Add `!conpaws` chat command linking to the website
- Put "Building ConPaws" in stream title when working on it
- Don't force it — work on it when you naturally would
- Clip cool moments (first build running, features working)

### Twitter/X (Reach)

**Content Types**
- Screenshot + short caption (highest engagement)
- Dev progress threads ("Week 3 of building ConPaws:")
- Polls ("Which feature matters most to you?")
- Memes about con WiFi being terrible (relatable = shares)
- Retweet/quote people talking about con apps

**Hashtags**
- `#furry` `#furryconvention` `#indiedev` `#reactnative` `#ConPaws`
- Don't overdo it — 2-3 per post max

**Posting Cadence**
- 2-3 posts per week during active development
- Don't ghost for weeks — even a small screenshot keeps momentum
- Boost around convention season (spring/summer)

---

## YouTube

### Launch Video — "Introducing ConPaws"

**Length:** 60-90 seconds max

**Script Outline:**
1. **Hook (5 sec)** — "Con WiFi just died and you can't check the schedule."
2. **Problem (10 sec)** — Convention apps suck. Paper schedules get lost. Spreadsheets aren't fun.
3. **Solution (10 sec)** — "ConPaws — your convention companion app." Show the app.
4. **Features walkthrough (30-40 sec)** — Quick cuts of each feature in action
   - Building a schedule
   - Your profile/fursona
   - Works offline
   - ConPaws+ sync
5. **CTA (10 sec)** — "Download free on iOS and Android. Link in description."
6. **End card** — App icon, download links, social links

**Style**
- Screen recordings of the real app (not mockups)
- Upbeat background music (royalty-free)
- Your voiceover (your community knows your voice)
- Keep it snappy — quick cuts, no dead air

### Future Videos
- "How I Built ConPaws" — dev journey, tech decisions
- "ConPaws at [Convention Name]" — real usage footage
- Feature spotlight videos (30-60 sec each)
- "ConPaws 2.0" — major update showcase

### Year 2 and Beyond

By month 12 you have 12-24 active subscribers. Year 2 costs drop to $111 (no Google Play fee). If growth continues:

| Scenario | End of Year 2 Subs | Year 2 Revenue | Year 2 Profit |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1/mo | 24 active | ~$740 | ~$629 |
| 2/mo | 48 active | ~$1,480 | ~$1,369 |

### Reality Check

- These assume zero churn. Real churn is ~15-20%/month for small apps
- With churn, steady-state active subs plateau (~5 active for 1/mo, ~10 for 2/mo)
- Yearly subscribers help a lot — one $24.99 yearly = 6+ months of a monthly sub
- **Bottom line: this app will pay for itself, but it's not a money-maker.** That's fine — it's a community tool first, revenue second

---

## Key Principles

1. **Build in public** — People love following the journey
2. **Community first** — Your Discord is your secret weapon
3. **Don't oversell** — It's a free app that helps at cons, not a startup pitch
4. **Convention timing** — Marketing peaks before con season (March-June)
5. **Relatable > polished** — Furries trust authentic over corporate
6. **Screenshots sell** — Every post should have a visual when possible
